# Challenge 11 - Recommend Similar Movies

## Overview

The objective of this challenge is to develop a function that takes a movie ID as input and returns a list of movies that are similar to the input movie. The returned list should be sorted in descending order of similarity.

**This challenge consists of two parts:**

a. Get similar movies for a given movie using Jaccard similarity index
b. Get similar movies for a given movie using Cosine similarity index

## Instructions

For both parts, you will need to implement the following API endpoint:

```http
GET /api/movie/get/similarMovies/:option/:movieId
```

i. The `option` parameter specifies the method to be used to calculate the similarity index. It can have one of the following values:

- `jaccard`: Use the Jaccard similarity index to calculate the similarity between movies.
- `cosine`: Use the Cosine similarity index to calculate the similarity between movies.

ii. The `movieId` parameter specifies the ID of the movie for which you want to find similar movies.

This API calls the `getSimilarMovies()` function in the `src/controller/movieController.js` file. You need to implement the function according to the option parameter, where the function should implment the logic to get similar movies for the given movie using Jaccard or Cosine similarity index. Finally, the function should return a list of similar movies sorted in descending order of similarity. (i.e. From most similar to least similar)

#### Note

- When similarity index is same for two movies, the order should be based on the movie's title in ascending order.
- When similarity index is high for a movie A and low for a movie B, movie A should come before movie B in the list.

## a. Get similar movies using Jaccard similarity index

The Jaccard similarity index is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets and is defined as the `size of the intersection` divided by the `size of the union` of the sample sets.

```text
Jaccard Similarity = (Intersection of A and B) / (Union of A and B)
```

In this segment of the challenge, you'll employ the Jaccard similarity index to generate recommendations for movies that bear resemblance to a specified movie.

To accomplish this, you'll need to create a set for each movie that includes its `genres`, `actors`, and `directors`.

#### example

Consider the following movie:

```json
{
      "id": "b5f37e47-40a7-4688-b6aa-420356eabcf8",
      "title": "The shawshank redemption",

          "Adventure",

      "bannerUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MpMh9upxL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg",
      "plot": "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, where he forms a friendship with fellow inmate Red and ultimately engineers a daring escape over the course of two decades, all while maintaining his innocence. Through perseverance, hope, and resilience, Andy triumphs over adversity and finds redemption on the outside.",
      "runtime": "2h 22m",
      "directedBy": "Frank Darabont",
      "starring": "Tim Robbins,Morgan Freeman",
      "releaseAt": "2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z",
      "isDeleted": 0
  }
```

The set of this movie should be like follow,

```text
[Romance, Adventure, Drama, Frank Darabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman]
```

Subsequently, you can compute the similarity index between the reference movie and all other movies by comparing their respective sets and put it as an attribute to all other movies.
Finally, you can arrange the movies in descending order based on their similarity index to the reference movie, thereby producing a list of recommended movies.

**The response from the `GET /api/movie/get/similarMovies/jaccard/ad41b6f6-d79f-4e58-89d6-9bb53498ccd9` API should be as follow.**

## b. Get similar movies using Cosine similarity index

The Cosine similarity index is a metric used to determine how similar two non-zero vectors are. It is calculated by taking the dot product of the two vectors and dividing it by the product of their magnitudes.

```text
Cosine Similarity = (A . B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
```

Where `A` and `B` are the vectors to be compared, and `||A||`(magnitude of A) and `||B||`(magnitude of B) are the **Euclidean norms/L2 norms** of the vectors.

In this challenge, you'll use the Cosine similarity index to recommend movies similar to a given movie. This approach only considers the genres of the movies.

Each movie is represented as a binary vector, with each element corresponding to a genre. The vector is generated based on the order of the genres in the genre table.

```text
[ 'Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Drama', 'Thriller', 'Romance', 'Fantasy' ]
```

For example, consider the movie `"The Shawshank Redemption"` with genres `"Romance"`, `"Adventure"`, and `"Drama"`. Its vector representation is:

The vector for the above movie should be like follow,

```text
[ 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0 ]
```

The similarity index between the given movie and every other movie is calculated by comparing their vectors using cosine similarity. This value is added as an attribute to all movies. The movies are then sorted in descending order of their similarity index to the given movie, providing a list of recommended movies.

**The response from the `GET /api/movie/get/similarMovies/cosine/ad41b6f6-d79f-4e58-89d6-9bb53498ccd9` API should be as follow.**
